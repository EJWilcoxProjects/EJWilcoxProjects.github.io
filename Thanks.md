Across these projects, there are a few people I would like to thank for inspiration and aid in the work.

[Jeremy Bell](http://jeremyseanbell.com) Creator of the Doublestop rocker. Thank you for letting me contribute to this creation and develop it in other directions.

[Adrian](https://forum.pjrc.com/members/41366-adrian) and contribution of [Dual FSR code](https://forum.pjrc.com/threads/31797-Teensy-FSR-based-MIDI-controller) for Teensy (needs further test on the rocker)

[Miguel Ortiz](https://miguel-ortiz.com) for guidance and aid throughout the projects, in particular the Doublestop rocker project.

[Alex Lucas](https://pure.qub.ac.uk/en/persons/alex-lucas-2) for initial help with PCB prototype manufacturing

[TheStuffMade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xczeQMj2dg) a very helpful video in the PCB making process.

[ScottHelmke](http://scotthelmke.com/Mint-box-buffer.html) for his piezo buffer board schematic and design. Hopefully this board will be a successful project of mine in the near future.
