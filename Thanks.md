Across these projects, there are a few people I would like to thank for inspiration and aid in the work.

[Jeremy Bell](http://jeremyseanbell.com) Creator of the Doublestop rocker. Thank you for letting me contribute to this creation and develop it in other directions.

[Adrian](https://forum.pjrc.com/members/41366-adrian) who contributed [dual FSR code](https://forum.pjrc.com/threads/31797-Teensy-FSR-based-MIDI-controller) for Teensy (needs further test on the rocker)
