##Piezo Buffer Board


The piezo buffer board is inspired heavily by [Scott Helmke's](http://scotthelmke.com/Mint-box-buffer.html) mint-box piezo buffer.

It is important to premise that although there were personal expenses put into the project, still lack of certain components rendered this project impossible to test. Instead, this piezo buffer board will look at the design and outcome of the board. 

Additionally, further to be discussed is component substitution and a continuation of the CAM and CAD process in the CAM step-by-step guide.

Seen above, Scott's schematic is centered around a JFET 2N5457; a transistor used for tone modulation, amplification and more. In a simplified way to understand this circuit, the audio signal travelling through has a gain switch for two different options. The 2N5457 is used to retain bass and maintain a better level of fidelity than without any pre-amp or buffer.

Misunderstanding the diagram early on in the process, I had created an initial large prototype with a 3D casing.
