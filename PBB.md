##Piezo Buffer Board

The piezo buffer board is inspired heavily by [Scott Helmke's](http://scotthelmke.com/Mint-box-buffer.html) mint-box piezo buffer.

It is important to premise that although there were personal expenses in the project, still lack of certain components rendered this project impossible to test. Instead, this piezo buffer board will look at the design and outcome of the board. 

Additionally, further to be discussed is component substitution and a continuation of the CAM and CAD process in the CAM step-by-step guide.
