<h1 align="center">Exciter Attachment Test</h1>

In this short experiment, I compared three attachment methods of electrodynamic exciters. One method is using the standard adhesive connection provided by the exciter itself, the second is using hot glue as a temporary join, and third is using masking tape superglue method.

To analyse the effectiveness of these methods, I use a constant, which in this case is a cardboard box with a measured distance from the center for the exciter to be adhered to. 

A cardboard box is used, with four different equidistant points from the edges of the box, 40mm x 60mm from the centre. Once one method is complete, the exciter is removed, and placed on one of the previously non-attached points. Then the recordings and experiment are run again.

This short test shows that hot glue significantly makes the sound muddier than the other attachment methods. The perforated board seems better at staying true to the original adhesive method of surface excitation.

Furthermore, this method protects the exciter, unlike the hot glue which can potentially damage the component.
