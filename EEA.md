<h1 align="center">Exciter Attachment Test</h1>

In this short experiment, I compared three attachment methods of electrodynamic exciters. One method is using the standard adhesive connection provided by the exciter itself, the second is using hot glue as a temporary join, and third is using masking tape superglue method.

To analyse the effectiveness of these methods, I use a constant, which in this case is a cardboard box with a measured distance from the center for the exciter to be adhered to.
